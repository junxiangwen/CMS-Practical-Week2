## Content Explanation
### Explanation about my startup business and its S.M.A.R.T goals

I created this website as a game sales website, providing players with the latest and most complete games in real time, so that players can meet all the needs of the game through one of our websites
and at the same time discount some games, so that players can buy their favorite games at a cheaper price.

* **Specific：** Developing a very comprehensive game sales website that allows customers to visualize the features and prices of each game more intuitively.
* **Measurable** Set up for customer feedback, we hope that customers will give some comments on our website after purchasing our games, and we hope that these comments will help people who want to buy the games.
* **Achievable：** Discount coupons will be given to users who have purchased the game and reviewed it, which will make their next purchase cost less money，and also provide some positive help to our site.
* **Relevant:** In the current environment, more people are starting to recognize games, so we'll be targeting all groups，and hopefully uploading our ads on some video sites and getting some cooperation and help from game makers.
* **Time-bound** Accumulate some stable customers in six months time and sign up for membership on our website.

### Estimated hours
I spent about four hours to follow the video to make my joomla site.

### Content Insights
Joomla is a whole new way for me to make a website, as we used to make them in the more traditional way of HTML, which makes it fun to make a website, but also has a lot of new skills to master.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
When I was working on Joomla I thought that wordpress might be a better way to make web pages, so after finishing the Joomla site, I prepped some Wordpress a little bit and tried to make the site in Wordpress because I thought that wordpress might be a more recognized.
